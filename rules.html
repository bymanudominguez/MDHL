                            <p><strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                                within
                                a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be
                                adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the competition program must be
                                a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in
                                the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                                assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                                whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                                from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
                                field may be required to play all their games away.</p>
